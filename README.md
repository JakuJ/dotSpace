This framework provides support to concurrent and distributed programming with (tuple) spaces in .NET.

The framework was designed and developed by [Shane D. McLean](https://github.com/sequenze) in collaboration with [Alberto Llluch Lafuente](https://github.com/albertolluch).

Please go to dotSpace's [wiki page](https://github.com/pSpaces/dotSpace/wiki) to [get started](https://github.com/pSpaces/dotSpace/wiki/getting-started) with programming with spaces in .NET.
