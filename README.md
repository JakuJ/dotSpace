This framework provides support to concurrent and distributed programming with (tuple) spaces in .NET.

The framework was designed and developed by [Shane D. McLean](https://github.com/sequenze) in collaboration with [Alberto Llluch Lafuente](https://github.com/albertolluch).

The current milestone will be flagged with V.1.0.1.
